# SBA-316

I created this small single-page web application to demonstrate my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM)
Purpose:

<h1>Purpose: </h1>

<p>
As the creator of "Araw-araw," a website named after the Tagalog term for "Every Day," I designed it as a daily digital companion, prompting me to stay focused on my end goal. With simplicity in mind, I crafted this platform to serve as a regular reminder of a singular aspiration. By intentionally limiting the platform to one goal, I prevent diluting my focus and maintain my momentum by reminding myself what I'm working towards.

This website prompts a deadline and by checking in daily, I steadily move closer to that date. The platform allows users the freedom to engage as they prefer â€“ whether with brief updates or detailed reflections, consistency is key. Ultimately, the primary focus is simply showing up. The grade is based on the actual number of check-ins to the total possible check-ins.

I've designed the platform to be adaptable, allowing users to contribute as little or as much as they wish in their daily reflections. While I've chosen my graduation date from the Per Scholas WISE program as my goal, I encourage users to set their own date that they can progress towards!
