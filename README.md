# SBA-316

I created this small single-page web application to demonstrate my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM)
Purpose:

<h1>Purpose: </h1>

<p>
As the creator of "Araw-araw," a website named after the Tagalog term for "Every Day," I designed it as a reliable digital companion, prompting me daily to stay focused on my end goal. With simplicity in mind, I crafted this platform to serve as a daily reminder of a singular aspiration. By intentionally limiting the platform to one goal, I prevent diluting my focus and can concentrate my efforts, maintaining clarity and momentum.

By setting a deadline and committing to daily check-ins, I steadily move closer to my goal. The platform allows users the freedom to engage as they prefer â€“ whether with brief updates or detailed reflections, consistency is key. Ultimately, the primary focus is simply showing up. I've designed the platform to be adaptable, allowing users to contribute as little or as much as they wish in their daily reflections. While I've chosen my graduation date from the Per Scholas WISE program as my goal, I encourage users to set their own objectives and advance accordingly.
