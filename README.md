I created this small single-page web application to demonstrate my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM)
Purpose:

Requirements:
Cache at least one element using selectElementById

<h1>Purpose: </h1>

<p>This website has one single goal: To encourage the user to show up for themself. Every.single.day. It's quick and easy. You check-in, you write a response to yourself, and increase your streak
